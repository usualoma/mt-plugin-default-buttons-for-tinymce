# Default Buttons For TinyMCE

This plugin enables the Movable Type to use buttons included in the TinyMCE.

In the MT 5.2, we need to create css file for adjustment in order to use buttons included in the TinyMCE by default.
However, we can use without adjustment those buttons, after installing this plugin.
